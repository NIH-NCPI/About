The NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) program includes multiple organizational components that work in tandem to advance the goal of enabling a federated data ecosystem that will facilitate researcher-driven analyses of datasets across multiple cloud-based platforms and repositories. Each component serves a specific role and contributes to the success of the NCPI Program by working in alignment and collaboration with other NCPI components. NCPI organizational components include the following groups:
*   [NCPI Program Office in the Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS)](NIH-ODSS.md)
*   [NCPI Steering Committee](Steering-Committee.md)
*   [NCPI Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC)](ACC.md)
*   [External Advisory Board (EAB)](EAB.md)
*   [NCPI Technical Working Groups](Working-Groups.md)
*   [Interoperability Projects](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/Interoperability-Projects/blob/main/README.md)

The NCPI Program, overseen by NIH representatives, is a collaboration between platform team members and researchers running cross-platform research efforts to inform and validate interoperability approaches.

### [Learn more about NCPI's participating partners](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/Partners/blob/main/README.md)

NCPI was created as an outcome of the NIH Workshop on Cloud-Based Platforms Interoperability held at RENCI on October 3-4th, 2019 to facilitate interoperability among the genomic analysis platforms established by the NCI, NHGRI, NHLBI, and the NIH Common Fund.
