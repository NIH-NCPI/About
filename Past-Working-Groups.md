<h2> Background </h2>

Before the formation of the NCPI Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC), NCPI consisted of a series of working groups to serve as the governance body of NCPI projects, steward working group progress, support investigators, and coordinate with various parts of the NIH. 

 | Working Group | Activities |
 | ------------- | --------- |
 | Coordination Working Group | Facilitate Wworking Group calls <br> Facilitate workshop organization | 
 | Community Governance Working Group | Refine interoperability principlels white paper <br> Understand roadblocks to interoperability across different communities (resarchers, developers, funders, etc.) |
 | Systems Interoperation Working Group | Identify research use cases for interoperability and test/implement standards <br> Establish charter and develop 12-month roadmap |
 | Training Working Group | Host trainings to familiarize developers with the different NCPI platforms <br> Document cloud costs through examples |
 | FHIR Working Group | Understand how cloud-based resources can leverage FHIR resources to serve the clinical data sharing needs of their communities |
